# Classic Frogger Game
In this game you have a Player,Enemies (Bugs), and lots of Treasure (Collectables) ! The goal of the player is to collect as many as possible the different collectables like Gems, Stars and Hearts ! without colliding with the bugs. Be aware ! the path is not simple. You have to be cautious about Rocks also. The game is time based, so you have to mind the time also. So, for winning the game you have to collect the treasure in the pre defined time. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy or reaches the water the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
